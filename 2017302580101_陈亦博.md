The flow control will slow down the transport speed to no more than 50 Mbps on average.
At first host A will send packet at 120 Mbps. Due to the slow link between them, some packets might be lost.
But it won't be long before host B's buffer becomes full. Then host A has to wait until B says its buffer has some space for left packets. 
Since host A only sends when B has space for new packets, the speed is up to host B's speed, which is 50 Mbps.

We need 3 duplicated ACK. We can consider this situation, if packet 1,2,3 are sent, and that packet 1 is received and has received ACK. 
If packet 2 and 3 are reordered when arrived at the receiver, then when receiver received packet 3, 
it will generate a duplicated ack for n and would trigger a retransmission under a policy of waitting only for 2nd duplicate ack for retransmission. 
If the policy is waitting for a triple duplicated ack, it must be the case that 2 packets after packet 1 are correctly received, while 2 was not received. 
So in order to trigger a quick transmission when needed, it must waitting for 2 packets. To sum up, 3 duplicated ack is mainly for the problem of reordered packages.

Traffic control will not work because the accept cache is large enough.
No packet loss, no timeout, so congestion control can not be applied.
There is no need to apply any measures, when the send cache is full, it will automatically slow down.
