The flow control will slow down the transport speed to no more than 50 Mbps on average.
At first host A will send packet at 120 Mbps. Due to the slow link between them, some packets might be lost.
But it won't be long before host B's buffer becomes full. Then host A has to wait until B says its buffer has some space for left packets. 
Since host A only sends when B has space for new packets, the speed is up to host B's speed, which is 50 Mbps.

We need 3 duplicated ACK. We can consider this situation, if packet 1,2,3 are sent, and that packet 1 is received and has received ACK. 
If packet 2 and 3 are reordered when arrived at the receiver, then when receiver received packet 3, 
it will generate a duplicated ack for n and would trigger a retransmission under a policy of waitting only for 2nd duplicate ack for retransmission. 
If the policy is waitting for a triple duplicated ack, it must be the case that 2 packets after packet 1 are correctly received, while 2 was not received. 
So in order to trigger a quick transmission when needed, it must waitting for 2 packets. To sum up, 3 duplicated ack is mainly for the problem of reordered packages.

P40.

a. slow start's interval is [3,6] [23,26]

b. congestion avoidance interval [6,16] [17,22]

c. After the 16th transmission round, packet loss is recognized by a triple duplicate ACK. If there was a timeout, the congestion window size would have dropped to 1.

d. After the 22nd transmission round, segment loss is recognized by a timeout.

e. ssthresh at first transmission round is 32.

f. ssthresh at the 18th transmission round is 21.

g. ssthresh at the 24th transmission round is 14.5.

h. The 70th segment is sent during the 7th transmission round.

i. Both the value of the congestion window size and the value of ssthresh are 4.

j. At the 19th round, the ssthresh is 21 and the congestion window size is 4.

k. 52 packets have been sent out from 17th round till 22nd round.
