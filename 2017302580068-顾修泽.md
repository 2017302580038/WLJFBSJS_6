### P28
TCP allows sender a to maintain a receiving window to provide traffic control. Host B puts the real-time rwnd value into the message sent to a to inform B of the cache size. A make sure that lastbytesent - lastbyteacked < = rwnd, when the cache is insufficient, sending data to B will be suspended.
### P40
a. [1, 6] and [23, 26]<br>
b. [6, 16] and [17, 22]<br>
c. Three redundant acks<br>
D. timeout<br>
E. 32<br>
F. 21<br>
G. 14<br>
h. packet 70 is transmitted in the seventh transmission cycle<br>
i. ssthresh = 4ï¼Œcwnd = 7<br>
j. ssthread = 21, CWnd = 4<br>
k. 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 21 = 52packets
### P44
A. Add 1 MSS to each RTT, so 6 RTTS are needed<br>
B. 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 51 MSS<br>
51mss / 6rtt = 8.5 MSS / RTT
