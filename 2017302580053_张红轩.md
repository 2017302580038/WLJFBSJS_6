(a）The time intervals of slow start are 1-6 and 23-26

(b)   The time intervals of congestion avoidance are 7-16 and 17-22

(c)	A triple duplicate ACK because the congestion window size is  cwnd = ssthresh + 3MSS = 24

(d)	A timeout.  Because the cwnd is 1, not ssthresh + 3MSS

(e)	32

(f)	42/2=21

(g)	ssthresh = 29/2 = 14

(h)	During slow start: 1+2+4+8+16+32= 63

​			During 7<sup>th</sup> transmission round: 63+33 = 96 > 70, 

​		so during 7<sup>th</sup> transmission round

(i）ssthresh = 8/2 = 4, cwnd = ssthresh + 3MSS = 4+3 = 7

(j)	If  TCP Tahoe is used, the ssthresh at 16<sup>th</sup> round is 21, so cwnd is 1, turn into slow start phase, so at 19<sup>th</sup> round, the cwnd is 4, and ssthresh is 21.

(k)	From (j) we know that the ssthresh is 21 so at 22nd round, the cwnd is exactly 21 after calculation,  the number of  total packets sent out form 17th till 22nd round is:

1+2+4+8+16+21 = 52

(a) Because cwnd increases 1 MSS for each RTT, so it take 6RTT for cwnd to increase from 6 MSS to 12MSS

(b) S = 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 51MSS

​		So the average throughput should be 51/6 = 8.5 MSS/RTT

## 3.P45

(a) From W/(2 · RTT) to W/RTT, the number of packets  transferred is:

​	n = (W/2) + (W/2 + 1) + (W/2 + 2) + ...... + (W) = (W/2+W)*(W-W/2+1)/2 = 3/8\*(W<sup>2</sup>)+3/4\*(W)

​	form the question we know that only one packet is lost , so L = 1/ n, which is the expression in the question.

(b)  From the first question, when the W is big enough, which mean 3/8(W<sup>2</sup>) >> 3/4\*(W), 

​	so W can  approximately regarded  as sqrt(8/(3*L))

​	for average rate = (0.75\*W)/RTT, use sqrt(8/(3*L)) replace the W, so 

​	 average rate = (1.22\*MSS)/(RTT*sqrt(L))
