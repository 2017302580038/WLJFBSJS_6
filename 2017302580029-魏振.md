### P40: Answer  
a. The intervals of time when TCP slow start is operating are [1,6] and [23,26].  
b. The intervals of time when TCP congestion avoidance is operating [6,16] and [17,22].  
c. After the 16th transmission round, packet loss is recognized by a triple duplicate ACK. If there was a timeout, the congestion window size would have dropped to 1.  
d. After the 22nd transmission round, segment loss is recognized by a timeout.  
e. The initial value of ssthresh at first transmission round is 32.  
f. The value of ssthresh at the 18th transmission round is 21.  
g. The value of ssthresh at the 24th transmission round is 14.5.  
h. The 70th segment is sent during the 7th transmission round.  
i. Both the value of the congestion window size and the value of ssthresh are 4.
j. At the 19th round, the ssthresh is 21 and the congestion window size is 4.  
k. 52 packets have been sent out from 17th round till 22nd round.  
  
  
### P44: Answer
a. It takes 6RTTs for cwnd to increase from 6MSS to 12MSS.  
b. The average throughout for this connection up through time=6RTT is (1+2+3+4+5+6)MSS / 6RTT = 3.5 MSS/RTT.
