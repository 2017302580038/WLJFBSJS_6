### P36

Consider packet n, n + 1, n + 2 are sent, but are received in the order n, n + 2, n + 1. Suppose packet n is ACKed.

In the case of retransmission on receiving 2 duplicate ACKs in a row, when the receiver receives packet n + 2, it will send a duplicate ACK of packet n + 1, then the sender retransmits packet n + 1, which causes unnecessarry retransimission of packet n + 1.

In the case of retransmission on receiving 3 duplicate ACKs in a row, when the sender recieves 2 duplicate ACKs of packet n + 1, it will just ignore it, thus reducing unnecessarry retransmission. 

### P40

#### a.

[1, 6] and [23, 26]

#### b.

[6, 16] and [17, 22]

#### c.

It is detected by a triple duplicate ACKs. If there was a timeout, the cwnd would have been dropped to 1.

#### d.

It is detected by a timeout. If there was a triple duplicate ACKs, the cwnd would have been ssthresh + 3.

#### e.

32, because slow start stops and congestion avoidance begins at this window size.

#### f.

42 / 2 = 21

#### g.

29 / 2 = 14.5, round down to 14.

#### h.

1st round: packet 1 is sent,

2nd round: packet 2-3 are sent,

3rd round: packet 4-7 are sent,

4th round: packet 8-15 are sent,

5th round: packet 16-31 are sent,

6th round: packet 32-63 are sent,

7th round: packet 64-127 are sent.

Thus the 70th segment is sent during the 7th transmission round.

#### i.

cwnd will be 7 and ssthresh will be 4.

#### j.

ssthresh will be 21 and cwnd will be 4.

#### k.

17th round: 1 packet is sent,

18th round: 2 packets are sent,

19th round: 4 packets are sent,

20th round: 8 packets are sent,

21st round: 16 packets are sent,

22nd round: 21 packets are sent. (cwnd will be 21 at the 22nd round, not surpassing the ssthresh.)

Thus the total number is 52.

### P46

#### a.

Let W denote the max window size in segments, we have

W * MSS / RTT = 10 Mbps, that is,

W = 10 * 10<sup>6</sup> * 150 * 10<sup>-3</sup> / (1500 * 8) = 125

#### b.

Average cwnd = 0.75W = 93.75, round up to 94.

Average throughput = 94 * 1500 * 8 / 0.15 = 7.52 Mbps

#### c.

ssthresh = 125 / 2 = 62.5, round down to 62.

(125 - 62) * 0.15 = 9.45 seconds
