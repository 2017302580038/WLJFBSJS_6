## P31
Use these functions：
* EstimateRTT = (1-α) * EstimateRTT + α * SampleRTT  
* DevRTT = (1-β) * DevRTT + β * | SampleRTT - EstimatedRTT|  
* TimeoutInterval = EstimateRTT + 4 * DevRTT  

Especially, α = 0.125, β = 0.25  
1. First SampleRTT = 106ms  
   * EstimateRTT = 0.875 * 100 + 0.125 * 106 = 100.75 ms  
   * DevRTT = 0.75 * 5 + 0.25 * |106-100| = 5.25 ms  
   * TimeoutInterval = 100.75 + 4 * 5.25 = 121.75 ms  
2. Second SampleRTT = 120ms  
   * EstimateRTT = 0.875 * 100.75 + 0.125 * 120 = 103.16 ms  
   * DevRTT = 0.75 * 5.25 + 0.25 * |120-100.75| = 8.75 ms  
   * TimeoutInterval = 103.16 + 4 * 8.75 = 138.16 ms  
3. Third SampleRTT = 140ms  
   * EstimateRTT = 0.875 * 103.16 + 0.125 * 140 = 107.76 ms  
   * DevRTT = 0.75 * 8.75 + 0.25 * |140-103.16| = 15.77 ms  
   * TimeoutInterval = 107.76 + 4 * 15.77 = 170.84 ms  
4. Fourth SampleRTT = 90ms  
   * EstimateRTT = 0.875 * 107.76 + 0.125 * 90 = 105.54 ms  
   * DevRTT = 0.75 * 15.77 + 0.25 * |90-107.76| = 16.27 ms  
   * TimeoutInterval = 105.54 + 4 * 16.27 = 170.62 ms  
5. Fifth SampleRTT = 115ms  
   * EstimateRTT = 0.875 * 105.54 + 0.125 * 115 = 106.72 ms  
   * DevRTT = 0.75 * 16.27 + 0.25 * |115-105.54| = 14.57 ms  
   * TimeoutInterval = 106.72 + 4 * 14.57 = 165 ms  

## P40  
**a.** SlowStart is running during [1, 6] and [23, 26]  
**b.** Congestion control is running during [6, 16] and [17, 22]  
**c.** It's detected by triple duplicated ACK. If it's due to a timeout, the congestion window size will be reduced to 1.  
**d.** It's detected by timeout, because after that the window size reduce to 1.  
**e.** ssthresh = 32, since after the window size reaches 32, it starts to increase linearly.  
**f.** ssthresh = 21, since the threshold is set to the half of the window size when loss is detected, and in 16th round, window size is 42. So new ssthresh is 21.  
**g.** ssthresh = 14, half of 29(round down).  
**h.** 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 +32 = 63 < 70  
   63 + 33 = 96 > 70  
   So the 70th packet is sent in 7th round.  
**i.** ssthresh = 4, half of 8  
   window size = 7, ssthresh + 3  
**j.** In 17th round after loss detected, ssthresh = 21, window size = 1.  
   In 18th, ssthresh = 21, window size = 2.  
   So, in 19th ssthresh = 21, window size = 4.  
**k.** 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 21(reaches ssthresh = 21) = 52 packets.  

## P44
**a.** It takes 6RTT to increase to 12MSS  
| Time  | cwnd  |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1RTT  | 7MSS  |
| 2RTT  | 8MSS  |
| 3RTT  | 9MSS  |
| 4RTT  | 10MSS |
| 5RTT  | 11MSS |
| 6RTT  | 12MSS |  
**b.** At nRTT, during the last RTT, (n+5) packets were sent (dur to the cwnd at (n-1)RTT). Thus the total packets number sent till 6RTT was 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 51.  
51 / 6 = 8.5 MSS/RTT.
