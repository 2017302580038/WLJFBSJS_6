**Q27**

a. The sequence number is 207, source port number is 302 and destination port number is 80.

b. The acknowledgment number is 207, the source port number is 80 and the destination port number is 302.

c. If the second segment arrives before the first segment, the acknowledgement number is 127, indicating that it is still waiting for bytes 127 and onwards.

**Q31**

Because:

DevRTT = (1-beta) * DevRTT + beta * |SampleRTT - EstimatedRTT| 

EstimatedRTT = (1-alpha) * EstimatedRTT + alpha * SampleRTT

TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4 * DevRTT

Then we can have:

When SqmpleRTT = 106 ms:

DevRTT = 5.25 ms

EstimatedRTT =  100.75 ms

TimeoutInterval = 121.75 ms

After when  SqmpleRTT = 120 ms:

DevRTT = 8.75 ms

EstimatedRTT =  103.16 ms

TimeoutInterval = 138.16 ms

After when  SqmpleRTT = 140 ms:

DevRTT = 15.77 ms

EstimatedRTT =  107.76 ms

TimeoutInterval = 170.84 ms

After when  SqmpleRTT = 90 ms:

DevRTT = 16.27 ms

EstimatedRTT =  105.54 ms

TimeoutInterval = 170.62 ms

After when  SqmpleRTT = 115 ms:

DevRTT = 14.57 ms

EstimatedRTT =  106.72 ms

TimeoutInterval = 165 ms

**Q40**

a. [1, 6] and [23, 26].

b. [6, 16] and [17, 22].

c. The packet loss is recognized by a triple duplicate ACK.

d. The segment loss is detected due to timeout.

e. The threshold is 32, because it is at this window size that slow start stops and congestion avoidance begins.

f. When loss is detected during transmission round 16, the congestion windows size is 42. Hence the threshold is 21.

g. When loss is detected during transmission round 22, the congestion windows size is 29. Hence the threshold is 14 (lower floor of 14.5).

h. It can be known from the image that packet 70 is sent in the 7th transmission round.

i. The current value of the congestion window is 8, thus the new values of the threshold and window size will be 4 and 7 respectively.

j. threshold is 21, and congestion window size is 1.

k. round 17, 1 packet; round 18, 2 packets; round 19, 4 packets; round 20, 8 packets;

round 21, 16 packets; round 22, 21 packets. The total number is 52.
