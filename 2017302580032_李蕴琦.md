a  UDP packages the user data directly into a message and transmits it immediately, whereas TCP writes the data into a cache and may split it into multiple messages.
b  TCP has traffic control and congestion control, while UDP does not.

## P43
Traffic control will not apply because the acceptance cache is large enough. congestion control will also not apply because there is no packet loss and no timeout. There is no need to apply any other measures, and when the sending cache is full, it automatically slows down.
