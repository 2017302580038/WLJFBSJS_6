### P40

#### question a

The intervals of time is [1, 6], [23, 26].

#### question b

The intervals of time is [6, 16], [17, 22].

#### question c

Segment loss is detected by a triple duplicate ACK.

#### question d

Segment loss is detected by a timeout.

#### question e

The initial value is 32.

#### question f

The value is 21.

#### question g

The value is 14.

#### question h

The 70th segment is sent during seventh transmission round.

#### question i

The value of the congestion window size is 7, and ssthresh is 4.

#### question j

The value of the congestion window size is 4, and ssthresh is 21.

#### question k

52 packets have been sent out.

### P44

#### question a

It takes 6 RTT for cwnd increase from 6 MSS to 12 MSS.

#### question b

The average throughout is:

(6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11) MSS / 6 RTT

= 8.5 (MSS / RTT)

### P46

#### question a

W = 10 * 106 * 150 * 0.001 / (1500 * 8)

= 125

#### question b

Average cwnd = 0.75W

= 93.75

So round up to 94.

Average throughput = 94 * 1500 * 8 / 0.15 

= 7.52 Mbps

#### question c

ssthresh = 125 / 2 

= 62.5

So round down to 62.

Time = (125 - 62) * 0.15

= 9.45s
