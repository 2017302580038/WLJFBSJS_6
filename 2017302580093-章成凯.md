# Homework 6

### Question 1 (Congestion Control)

> **a.** Identify the intervals of time when TCP slow start is operating.

>> **My Answer:** TCP slow start is operating at [1, 6], [23, 26]

> **b.** Identify the intervals of time when TCP congestion avoidance is operating.

>> **My Answer:** TCP congestion avoidance is operating at [6, 16], [17, 22]

> **c.** After the 16th transmission round, is segment loss detected by a triple duplicate ACK or by a timeout?

>> **My Answer:** Segment loss is detected by a triple duplicate ACK.

> **d.** After the 22nd transmission round, is segment loss detected by a triple duplicate ACK or by a timeout?

>> **My Answer:** Segment loss is detected by a timeout.

> **e.** What is the initial value of `ssthresh` at the first transmission round?

>> **My Answer:** The initial value of `ssthresh` at the first transmission round is 32.

> **f.** What is the value of `ssthresh` at the 18th transmission round?

>> **My Answer:** The value of `ssthresh` at the 18th transmission round is 42 / 2 = 21.

> **g.** What is the value of `ssthresh` at the 24th transmission round?

>> **My Answer:** The value of `ssthresh` at the 24th transmission round is 29 / 2 = 14.

> **h.** During what transmission round is the 70<sup>th</sup> segment sent?

>> **My Answer:** The 70<sup>th</sup> segment is sent during 7<sup>th</sup> transmission round.

> **i.** Assuming a packet loss is detected after the 26<sup>th</sup> round by the receipt of a triple duplicate ACK, what will be the values of the congestion window size and of `ssthresh` ?

>> **My Answer:** The values of the congestion window size will be 8 / 2 + 3 = 7, and `ssthresh` will be 8 / 2 = 4.

> **j.** Suppose TCP Tahoe is used (instead of TCP Reno), and assume that triple duplicate ACKs are received at the 16<sup>th</sup> round. What are the `ssthresh` and the congestion window size at the 19<sup>th</sup> round?

>> **My Answer:** The values of the congestion window size will be 2<sup>(19-16-1)</sup> = 4, and `ssthresh` will be 42 / 2 = 21.

> **k.** Again suppose TCP Tahoe is used, and there is a timeout event at 22<sup>nd</sup> round. How many packets have been sent out from 17<sup>th</sup> round till 22<sup>nd</sup> round, inclusive?

>> **My Answer:** 

| Round | Packets Sent |
| -- | -- |
| 17 | 1 |
| 18 | 2 |
| 19 | 4 |
| 20 | 8 |
| 21 | 16 |
| 22 | 21 |

1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 21 = 52 packets have been sent out from 17<sup>th</sup> round till 22<sup>nd</sup> round, inclusive.

### Question 2

> **P27.** Host A and B are communicating over a TCP connection, and Host B has already received from A all bytes up through byte 126. Suppose Host A then sends two segments to Host B back-to-back. The first and second segments contain 80 and 40 bytes of data, respectively. In the firstsegment, the sequence number is 127, the source port number is 302, and the destination port number is 80. Host B sends an acknowledgment whenever it receives a segment from Host A.

> **a.** In the second segment sent from Host A to B, what are the sequence number, source port number, and destination port number?

>> **My Answer:**

| Sequence Number | Source Port Number | Destination Port Number |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 127 + 80 = 207 | 302 | 80 |

> **b.** If the first segment arrives before the second segment, in the acknowledgment of the first arriving segment, what is the acknowledgment number, the source port number, and the destination port number?

>> **My Answer:**

| Acknowledgment Number | Source Port Number | Destination Port Number |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 207 | 80 | 302 |

> **c.** If the second segment arrives before the first segment, in the acknowledgment of the first arriving segment, what is the acknowledgment number?

>> **My Answer:** The acknowledgment number is still 127.

> **d.** Suppose the two segments sent by A arrive in order at B. The first acknowledgment is lost and the second acknowledgment arrives after the first timeout interval. Draw a timing diagram, showing these segments and all other segments and acknowledgments sent. (Assume there is no additional packet loss.) For each segment in your figure, provide the sequence number and the number of bytes of data; for each acknowledgment that you add, provide the acknowledgment number.

### Question 3

> **P44.** Consider sending a large file from a host to another over a TCP connection that has no loss.

> **a.** Suppose TCP uses AIMD for its congestion control without slow start. Assuming `cwnd` increases by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is received and assuming approximately constant round-trip times, how long does it take for `cwnd` increase from 6 MSS to 12 MSS (assuming no loss events)?

>> **My Answer:** it takes 12 - 6 = 6 RTT for `cwnd` increase from 6 MSS to 12 MSS (assuming no loss events).

> **b.** What is the average throughout (in terms of MSS and RTT) for this connection up through time=6 RTT ?

>> **My Answer:** The average throughout (in terms of MSS and RTT) for this connection up through time=6 RTT is (6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11) MSS / 6 RTT = 8.5 (MSS / RTT)
