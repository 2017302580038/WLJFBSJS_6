## Assignment 6

### P40
a. The interval slow start intervals are [1,6] and [23,26]
b. The congestion avoidance intervals are [6,16] and [17,22]
c. The segment loss is detected by a triple duplicate ACK.
d. It's detected by a timeout.
e. The initial value of ssthresh at first transmission round is 32.  ()
f. The value of ssthresh at the 18th transmission round is 42/2=21.  
g. The value of ssthresh at the 24th transmission round is 29/2=14.5.  
h. Transmission Round |Segments| Sended Segments 
-|-
1st | 1 | 1
2nd | 2 | 2,3
3rd | 4 | 4~7
4th | 8 | 8~15
5th | 16 | 16~31
6th | 32 | 32~63
7th | 33 | 64~96
i. ssthresh = cwnd/2 = 8/2 = 4, the value of the congestion window size is also 4.
j. At the 16th round: ssthresh = 42/2 = 21, cwnd is set to 1.
   So at the 19th round: ssthresh =21, the congestion window size is 4. 
k. From 17th round till 22nd round,there are 1+2+4+8+16+21=52 packets.

### P44
a. cwnd increases by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is received, then from 6 MSS to 12 MSS, it takes (12-6)/1=6RTT
b. (6+7+8+9+10+11)/6=8.5 MSS/RTT

### P46
a. Assume the max window size is W,then we have the equation W * 1500 * 8/0.15 = 10 * 10^6,solve it and we have W=125 segments.
b. Average window size is(0.5*125+125)/2=93.75 segments.The average throughput is 93.75 * 1500 * 8/0.15=7500000=7.5 Mbps.
c. When there's a packet loss, the window size changes to W/2=125/2=62.5 segments.To reach the maximum window again, it needs (125-62.5) * 0.15 s = 9.375 s.
