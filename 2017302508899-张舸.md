# Homework 6

## Problems

### R10

**Q:** In our rdt protocols, why did we need to introduce timers?  

**A:** When a packet is lost during the transmission, the sender can never receive the ack(or nak) from receiver. So we need a mechanism to automatically resend the lost packet. That's what timers comes for.

### R15

**Q:** 

Suppose Host A sends two TCP segments back to back to Host B over a TCP connection. The first segment has sequence number 90; the second has sequence number 110. 

a. How much data is in the first segment?

b. Suppose that the first segment is lost but the second segment arrives at B. In the acknowledgment that Host B sends to Host A, what will be the acknowledgment number?

**A:**

**a.** 110 - 90 = 20 (Byte)

**b.** It will be 90 since the first segment is lost.

### R18

**Q:**   True or false? Consider congestion control in TCP. When the timer expires at the sender, the value of ssthresh is set to one half of its previous value.  

**A:** False. It will be set to one half of current value.
