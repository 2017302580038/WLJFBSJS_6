## Homework 6

### P40

a. 1-6 and 23-26

b. 6-16 and 17-22

c. Triple duplicated ACK. Because the updated congestion window size is cwnd = cwnd/2 + 3 MSS = 24 MSS

d. Timeout. The updated cwnd = 1

e. 32, for the congestion avoidance is activated when cwnd = 32

f. 21 = 42/2

g. 14 = 29/2

h. During slow start, the number of transmitted segments is 2^6-1 = 63.
In the 7th transmission round, the number of transmitted segments should be 33, and 63+33>70.

So the 70th segment is transmitted during 7th transmission round.

i. ssthresh = cwnd/2 = 4     cwnd = cwnd/2 + 3 MSS = 7 MSS

j. ssthresh = 21, cwnd = 4, for that the TCP Tahoe will reset the cwnd as 1 when encoutering triple duplicated ACK.
The ssthresh updation formula is unchanged.

k. 1+2+4+8+16+21 = 52

### P44

a. It will take one RTT for each MSS transmission, so the time consumption should be 6 RTT.

b. S = 6+7+8+9+10+11 = 51. Average throughput should be 51/6 = 8.5 MSS/RTT

### P45

a. The TCP here should be in congestion avoidance stage. The total number of transmitted packets is W/2 + W/2+1 + W/2+2 + ... + W = 3W^2/8 + 3W/4.
The number of lost packet is 1. 
So the packet loss rate is L = 1/(3W^2/8 + 3W/4)

b. without considering the packet loss, the average throughput should be 0.75 * W/RTT. 

Considering the situation that W is so large that 3W^2/8 >> 3W/4. So it can be approximately concluded that W = sqrt(8/3L)

Replace the W in the original average throughput, we can find that it equals 1.22MSS/(RTT * sqrt(L))
