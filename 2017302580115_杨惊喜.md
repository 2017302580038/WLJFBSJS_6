# 第三章后作业选做3题（含一道拥塞控制的问题）
## P40
a.   
[1, 6] and [23, 26]

b.   
[6, 16] and [17, 22]   

c.   
Three redundancy ACK    

d.   
overtime    

e.   
32    

f.   
42/2 = 21    

g.    
29/2 = 14   

h.   
1st transmission round - packet 1    
2nd transmission round - packet 2-3     
3rd transmission round - packet 4-7   
4th transmission round - packet 8-15  
5th transmission round - packet 16-31  
6th transmission round - packet 32-63  
7th transmission round - packet 64-96  
So packet 70 is sent in the 7th transmission round.  

i.   
congestion window size = 8/2 + 3 = 7   
ssthresh = 8/2 = 4  

j.  
congestion window size = 8/2 + 3 = 1  
ssthresh = 8/2 = 21  

k.  
Round 17:1 packets    
Round 18:2 packets     
Round 19:4 packets   
Round 20:8 packets    
Round 21:16 packets   
Round 22:21 packets     
Total number is 1+2+4+8+16+21=52  

## P44
a.   
Add 1 MSS to each RTT, so 6 RTTS are needed  

b.   
6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 51 MSS    
The average throughput is 51mss / 6rtt = 8.5 MSS / RTT  

## P45
a.   
The number of packets sent in a cycle is:  
n = (W/2) + (W/2 + 1) + (W/2 + 2) + ...... + (W) = (3/8w^2)+(3/4w)   
So L = 1/ n = 1/(3/8w^2+3/4w)   

b.   
If w is large enough, then 3/8(W^2) >> 3/4*(W)   
Therefore  L= 1/(3/8w^2) approximately. w = (8/3L)^(1/2)   
Average rate = (w/(2RTT)+w/RTT)= 0.75w/RTT= 0.75*(8/3L)^(1/2)MSS/RTT= (1.22MSS)/(RTTL^(1/2))
