#### P40

**a.** [1, 6] and [23, 26]

**b.** [6, 16] and [17, 22]

**c.** Three redundant ACK

**d.** Timeout

**e.** 32

**f.** 42/2 = 21

**g.** 29/2 = 14

**h.** Packet 1 (P1) is transmitted in transmission cycle 1 (T1), P2-P3 is transmitted in T2, p4-p7 is transmitted in T3, p8-p15 is transmitted in T4, p16-p31 is transmitted in T5, p32-p63 is transmitted in T6, p64-p96 is transmitted in T7,

Therefore, packet 70 is transmitted in the seventh transmission cycle

**i.**  ssthresh = 4，cwnd = ssthresh + 3MSS = 7

**j.** In the 16th transmission cycle, ssthresh = cwnd / 2 = 21, cwnd = 1 and enters the slow start state. In the 19th transmission cycle, ssthresh = 21, cwnd = 4

**k.** T17：1，T18：2，T19：4，T20：8，T21：16，T22：21
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 21 = 52 

#### P42

Timeout can only slow down the situation that packets are not lost and retransmitted over time, and cannot prevent TCP from sending more new packets to the end-to-end path that may be congested.

#### P44

**a.**
Add 1 MSS to each RTT, so 6 RTTS are needed.

**b.**
6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 51 MSS
The average throughput is: 51MSS / 6RTT = 8.5 MSS/RTT
