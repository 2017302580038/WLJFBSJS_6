## P36

Considering three packets n, n1, n2, n is received and ACKed:

+ If retransmission when receive the first duplicate ACK(two):

  After receiving n2, it will generate a duplicate ACK->retransmission

+ If retransmission when receive the second duplicate ACK(three):

  After receiving n2, it will generate a duplicate ACK but not retransmit. Only if receivde the second duplicate ACK it will retransmit.

Therefore,The designers of the triple duplicate ACK scheme probably felt that waiting for two packets was the right tradeoff between triggering a quick retransmission when needed, but not retransmitting prematurely in the face of packet reordering.

## P40

a) [1,6], [23,26]

b)[6,16],[17,22]

c) triple duplicate  ACK. For if there was a timeout, the congestion window size would have dropped to 1.

d)Timeout. For the congestion window size dropped to 1.

e) 32. For it is at 32 that slow start stops and
congestion avoidance begins.

f)  21. When loss is detected during transmission round 16, the congestion
windows size is 42, so the threshold is 21.

g) 14. When loss is detected during transmission round 22, the congestion
windows size is 29, so the threshold is 14.

h) 7.

| transmission round | packet |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| 1                  | 1      |
| 2                  | 2-3    |
| 3                  | 4-7    |
| 4                  | 8-15   |
| 5                  | 16-31  |
| 6                  | 64-96  |

So at the 7th round send packet 70.

i) 4,7. 

+ The threshold will be set to half the current value of the congestion window (8) when the loss occurred , so the threshold is 4.

+  Congestion window will be set to the new threshold value + 3 MSS, so it is 7.

j) 21,1.

k) 52.

+ round 17: 1
+ round 18: 2
+ round 19: 4
+ round 20: 8
+ round 21: 16
+ round 12: 21

## P42

 TCP uses pipelining (and is therefore not a stop-and-wait protocol).It allows the sender to have multiple outstanding unacknowledged segments. The doubling of the timeout interval does not prevent a TCP sender from sending a large number of first-time-transmitted packets into the network, even when the end-to-end path is highly congested. Therefore a congestion control mechanism is needed to stem the flow of “data received from the application above” when there are signs of network congestion.
