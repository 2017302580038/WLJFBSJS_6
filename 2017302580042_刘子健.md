## P40.
a. [1, 6] and [23, 26]

b. [6, 16] and [17, 22]

c. Three redundancy ACK

d. overtime

e. 32

f. 42/2 = 21

g. 29/2 = 14

h. Packet 1 (P1) is transmitted in transmission cycle 1 (T1),
P2-P3 is transmitted in T2, p4-p7 is transmitted in T3, p8-p15 is transmitted in T4, p16-p31 is transmitted in T5,
p32-p63 is transmitted in T6, p64-p96 is transmitted in T7,
Therefore, packet 70 is transmitted in the seventh transmission cycle

i. ssthresh = 4，cwnd = ssthresh + 3MSS = 7

j. In the 16th transmission cycle, ssthread = CWnd / 2 = 21, CWnd = 1 
and enters the slow start state. In the 19th transmission cycle, ssthread = 21, CWnd = 4

k. t17：1个，t18：2个，t19：4个，t20：8个，t21：16个，t22：21个
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 21 = 52 个

## P43.
Traffic control will not work because the accept cache is large enough.

No packet loss, no timeout, so congestion control can not be applied.

There is no need to apply any measures, when the send cache is full, it will automatically slow down.

## P44.
a.
Add 1 MSS to each RTT, so 6 RTTS are needed

b.
6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 51 MSS
The average throughput is 51mss / 6rtt = 8.5 MSS / RTT
