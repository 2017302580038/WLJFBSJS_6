### Homework 6

#### Chapter 3
#### Problem 40

a. Slow start intervals: [1,6], [23,26]

b. Congestion avoidance intervals: [6,16], [17,22]

c. After the 16th transmission round, the segment loss is detected by a triple duplicate ACK.

d. After the 22nd transmission round, the segment loss is detected by a timeout.

e. 32

f. 42/2=21

g. 29/2=14.5â‰ˆ14

h. 
Transmission Round | Sended Segments 
-|-
1st | 1
2nd | 2,3
3rd | 4~7
4th | 8~15
5th | 16~31
6th | 32~63
7th | 64~96

The 70th segment is sent during the 7th transmission round.

i. ssthresh = cwnd/2 = 8/2 = 4

new_cwnd =ssthresh + 3 = 7

j. At the 16th round: ssthresh = cwnd/2 = 21, cwnd is set to 1.
  
  So at the 19th round: ssthresh =21, cwnd = 4.
  
k. 1+2+4+8+16+21=52 packets

#### Problem 44

a. cwnd increases by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is received, thus **time = (12-6)/1=6 RTT**

b. averageThroughout = (6+7+8+9+10+11) MSS / 6 RTT = 8.5 MSS/RTT

#### Problem 46

a. Assume the max window size(in segments) is W. Then we have **W * 1500 * 8/0.15 = 10 * 10^6** => **W = 125 segment**

b. The average window size is **(0.5W+W)/2=0.75W=94 segment**.

The average throughput is **94 * 1500 * 8/0.15=7.52 Mbps**.

c. When there's a packet loss, the window size changes to **W/2=125/2=62**.
To reach the maximum window again, we need **(125-62) * 0.15 s = 9.45 s**.
