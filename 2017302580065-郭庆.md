Four bytes means 2<sup>32</sup> possible TCP sequence numbers. And the sequence number does not increment by one with each segment. Rather, it increments by the number of bytes of data sent. **One byte of file cost one sequence number.** 

So, the maximum size file that can be sent from A to B is

2<sup>32</sup> * 1 bytes = 2<sup>32</sup> bytes =4GB

b)

For tcp transport.

Amount of transport

Size = Size<sub>segment</sub>+Size<sub>otherCost</sub>

amount = 
$$
\lceil\frac{2^{32}bytes}{536bytes}\rceil = 8012999 times
$$
otherCost for each round = 66bytes

So, the Total cost is 2<sup>32</sup> + 66bytes* 8012999 = 4.824*10<sup>9</sup>bytes

For 155-Mbps link, **it will cost 249 seconds to transmit file.**

## P29

a) cuz the need of **defending itself against SYN FlOOD attack.**

b) Nope, Half-Open connections are not possible since a server using SYN cookies doesn't maintain connection variables and buffers for any connection before full connection are established.

And if someone want to establish a fully open connection, an attacker should know the initial sequence number corresponding to source IP address from attacker. This sequence number requires the "secret" number that each server uses. **Since the attacker does not know this secret number** , he(she) can't guess the initial sequence number.

c)

No, the server can simply and in a time stamp in computing those initial sequence numbers and choose a time to live value for those sequence numbers, and **discard expired initial sequence numbers** even if the attacker replay them.

## P40

a. slow start's interval is [3,6] [23,26]

b. congestion avoidance interval [6,16] [17,22]

c. After the 16th transmission round, packet loss is recognized by a triple duplicate ACK. If there was a timeout, the congestion window size would have dropped to 1. 

 d. After the 22nd transmission round, segment loss is recognized by a timeout.  

e. ssthresh at first transmission round is 32. 

 f. ssthresh at the 18th transmission round is 21.  

g. ssthresh at the 24th transmission round is 14.5.  

h. The 70th segment is sent during the 7th transmission round.  

i. Both the value of the congestion window size and the value of ssthresh are 4.

j. At the 19th round, the ssthresh is 21 and the congestion window size is 4.  

k. 52 packets have been sent out from 17th round till 22nd round.
