### p33
If TCP measures SampleRTT for a retransmitted segment, there must be something wrong. If the source sends packet P1, then the timer for P1 ends and the source then sends P2, a new copy of the same packet. If the source measures SampleRTT for P2 and shortly after transmitting P2, an ACK for P1 arrives, the source will regard this ACK as for P2. So it will calculate a wrong value of SampleRTT.

### p36
We need 3 duplicated ACK. We can consider this situation, if packet 1,2,3 are sent, and that packet 1 is received and has received ACK. If packet 2 and 3 are reordered when arrived at the receiver, then when receiver received packet 3, it will generate a duplicated ack for n and would trigger a retransmission under a policy of waitting only for 2nd duplicate ack for retransmission. If the policy is waitting for a triple duplicated ack, it must be the case that 2 packets after packet 1 are correctly received, while 2 was not received. So in order to trigger a quick transmission when needed, it must waitting for 2 packets. 
To sum up, 3 duplicated ack is mainly for the problem of reordered packages.

### p40
a. TCP slowstart is operating in the intervals [0,6] and [23,26]

b.the intervals [6, 16] and [17,22]

c. it's triple duplicated ack. Because if there was a timeout, the congestion window size would have dropped to 1.

d. It's timeout, because the congestion window size has been dropped to 1.

e. The threshold is presumbly 32. From the 1st slowstart we can know it. 

f. From the 18th turn, it detected a packet loss. When loss detected the window size is 42, so the threshold is 21 during the 18th turn.

g. Like in question f, it detected loss at round 22, the congestion window size is 29, so the threshold is 14 during the 24th turn.

h. Just add packets each round, we know that it's in 7th transmission

i. the window size will be set to the new threshold calue plus 3 MSS. the threshold will be 4, and the window size will be 7.

j. Threshold is 21, the conjestion window size is 1.

k. 17th: 1pac; 18th:2pac; 19th:4pac;20th:8pac;21th:16pac;22th:21pc; so in sum, it's 52 packets.
