a.

    TCP slow start: [1,6] , [23,26].
  
b.

     TCP congestion avoidance: [6,16] , [17,22].
 
 c.
 
      A triple duplicate ACK.
    
d.

      Timeout.
 
 e.
 
      32.
    
f.

    42/2 = 21.
 
 g.
 
    29/2 = 14
 
    
h.

    1st transmission round - packet 1
    
    2nd transmission round - packet 2~3   
    
    3rd transmission round - packet 4~7 
    
    4th transmission round - packet 8~15
    
    5th transmission round - packet 16~31
    
    6th transmission round - packet 32~63
    
    7th transmission round - packet 64~96
    
    So packet 70 is sent in the 7th transmission round.
    
    
i.
 
    congestion window size = 8/2 + 3 = 7
 
    ssthresh = 8/2 = 4
    
    
j.
 
    congestion window size = 8/2 + 3 = 1
 
    ssthresh = 8/2 = 21
    
k.
 
    Round 17    1 packets;
    Round 18    2 packets;
    Round 19    4 packets;
    Round 20    8 packets;
    Round 21    16 packets;
    Round 22    21 packets;
    
    Total number is 1+2+4+8+16+21= 52

**P44**

a. 

    It takes
    1 RTT to increase cwnd to 7 MSS; 
    2 RTTs to increase cwnd to 8 MSS; 
    3 RTTs to increase cwnd to 9 MSS; 
    4 RTTs to increase cwnd to 10 MSS;
    5 RTTs to increase cwnd to 11 MSS;
    6 RTTs to increase cwnd to 12 MSS. 

    
  
b.

    In the first RTT, 6 MSS was sent;
    in the second RTT, 7 MSS was sent;
    in the third RTT, 8 MSS was sent;
    in the fourth RTT, 9 MSS was sent;
    in the fifth RTT, 10 MSS was sent;
    in the sixth RTT, 11 MSS was sent. 
    Thus, 6+7+8+9+10+11 = 51 MSS was sent.
    The average throughput up to time 6 RTT was (51 MSS)/(6 RTT) = 8.5 MSS/RTT.

**P46**

a. 

     W*MSS/RTT = 10Mbps,
     W*1500*8/0.15=10*10^6,
     W=125
     then W is about 125 segments. 
  
b.

    The average window size is 0.75W = 93.75 → 94 segments (since congestion window size varies from W/2 to W)
    Average throughput is 94*1500*8/0.15 =7.52Mbps. 
 
 c.

     (125-125/2)*0.15 = 9.45 s ( because there is a packet loss)
