# 3 Problems
## P23.
For GBN it is `k-1`. If sender window is has size `k`, when receiver receives all packets but all ACKs are lost, the sequence number of the next packet sender will send is same as what receiver is expecting, but they are actually not the same packet.  
For SR, if sender window has size `s`, then `s` must satisfy `2s <= k`. If `2s == k + 1` and all ACKs are lost, the sequence number of the first packet in the sender window is same as the last packet in the receiver window, but they are not the same packet.  
## P28.
The flow control will slow down the transport speed to no more than 50 Mbps on average. At first host A will send packet at 120 Mbps. Due to the slow link between them, some packets might be lost. But it won't be long before host B's buffer becomes full. Then host A has to wait until B says its buffer has some space for left packets. Since host A only sends when B has space for new packets, the speed is up to host B's speed, which is 50 Mbps. 
## P40.
a. 0 to 6, 23 to 26.  
b. 6 to 16, 17 to 22.  
c. 3 duplicate ACKs.  
d. timeout.  
e. 32.    
f. 29.  
g. 14.  
h. 7.  
i. Congestion window is 7, `ssthresh` is 4.  
j. Since TCP Tahoe unconditionally cuts congestion window to 1 MSS and enters the slow-start phase after either a timeout-indicated ot 3 duplicate ACK, the congestion window size at 19th round must be 4 and `ssthresh` is 21.  
k. 1+2+4+8+16+21=51 packets.
